4. Hiew (Hacker's View):

hiew is another popular command-line hex editor, though itâ€™s not available by default in many distributions, and you may need to compile it or install it from an external source.

All of these options are terminal-based, providing you the power to edit files in a hex format without any graphical interface.

Let me know if you'd like help with one of these tools or anything else!
