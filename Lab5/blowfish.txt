To encrypt a file with Blowfish using OpenSSL and then decrypt it, follow these steps:
1. Encrypt the File with Blowfish:

Use the openssl enc command with the bf cipher (Blowfish):

bash

openssl enc -bf -in myfile.txt -out encrypted_blowfish.bin -pass pass:yourpassword -base64

This command does the following:

    -bf: Specifies the Blowfish cipher.
    -in myfile.txt: The input file (myfile.txt) that you want to encrypt.
    -out encrypted_blowfish.bin: The output file that will contain the encrypted data.
    -pass pass:yourpassword: The password used for encryption (replace yourpassword with your desired password).
    -base64: Ensures the output is base64-encoded, making it easier to handle or view.

2. Decrypt the File:

To decrypt the file encrypted with Blowfish, run:

bash

openssl enc -d -bf -in encrypted_blowfish.bin -out decrypted_blowfish.txt -pass pass:yourpassword -base64

This command:

    -d: Specifies decryption mode.
    -bf: Uses the Blowfish cipher for decryption.
    -in encrypted_blowfish.bin: The encrypted file.
    -out decrypted_blowfish.txt: The output file that will contain the decrypted data.
    -pass pass:yourpassword: The same password used during encryption.
    -base64: Decodes the base64-encoded content.

Example:

bash

# Encrypt with Blowfish
openssl enc -bf -in myfile.txt -out encrypted_blowfish.bin -pass pass:napier -base64

# Decrypt with Blowfish
openssl enc -d -bf -in encrypted_blowfish.bin -out decrypted_blowfish.txt -pass pass:napier -base64

Ensure that you use the same password and encryption options (like base64 encoding) when decrypting t
